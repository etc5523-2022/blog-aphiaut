In this century, gender equality is an important issue that people are concerned about and trying to reduce it. However, it doesn't change what they expected. Whether it's a developed country like the USA, there are problems with gender equality, especially equal pay. All women were paid around 83 percent of the median income that men were paid, moreover, black women can get only 64 percent [(U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, 2022)](https://blog.dol.gov/2022/03/15/connecting-the-dots-womens-work-and-the-wage-gap?_ga=2.73116245.718959912.1662380513-411305466.1662380513). This reinforces that the USA where is a developed country and being a country with large economic influence in the world, it still faces problems about gender equality 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
p53ar <- read_excel("data/p53ar.xlsx", 
    range = "A10:G83", col_names = FALSE)

colnames(p53ar) = c("year", "num_wage_male", "median_current_male","median_2020_male", "num_wage_female", "median_current_female","median_2020_female" ) 

median_2020 <- pivot_longer(data = p53ar,
               cols = c("median_2020_male", "median_2020_female"),
               names_to = "median_2020") %>%
  select(year, median_2020, value)

median_2020$year <- as.numeric(median_2020$year) 
median_2020$value <- as.numeric(median_2020$value) 
```


```{r,  echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
line_1 <- median_2020 %>%
  filter(year > 1979) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value))+
  geom_line(aes(color = median_2020)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Median of Income by Sex") +
  #scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(10000, 51000, by = 5000))
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(10000, 51000, by = 5000))

ggplotly(line_1)
```

Figure 1 illustrates the median income between males and females from 1980 to 2020. It can be seen gaps between males and females are quite wide, however, the gap is likely to decrease in the future.


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fulltime <- university %>%
  mutate(women_percent = ShareWomen*100) %>%
  group_by(	Major_category) %>%
  summarise(avg_median = mean(Median, na.rm = TRUE),
            women_percent = mean(women_percent, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = women_percent, y = avg_median)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = Major_category), size = 4) +
  geom_point(colour = "grey90", size = 1.5) +
  ylab("Median Income") +
  xlab("Percentage of Women")+
  ggtitle("Median Income vs Percentage of Women")+
               theme(legend.position="bottom",
                     legend.text = element_text(size = 4)) +
  labs(color = "Major Category")

ggplotly(fulltime)
  
```


Figure 2 represents the average median income versus the percentage of women in each major category. It shows women can work in the engineering category, which is the highest median income of the categories, only 24%. While the psychology and social work category which is the lowest median income of the categories, and the health category has a share of women of around 80 percent. However, both categories are directly important to humans, there is a slight proportion for men.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
top_women <- university %>%
  filter(ShareWomen > 0.9) %>%
  arrange(-ShareWomen) %>%
  head() %>%
  select(Major, ShareWomen, Median) %>%
  kable()%>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)

top_women


```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
low_women <- university %>%
  filter(ShareWomen < 0.1) %>%
  arrange(-ShareWomen) %>%
  head()%>%
  select(Major, ShareWomen, Median) %>%
  kable()%>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)

low_women
```


Moreover, table 1 shows the majors in the colleges that have a share of women more than 90 percent. This result represents most of the median income are less than `35000` US dollar per year, except for Medical Assistant Services is `42000` Annual US dollar. On the contrary, table 2 illustrates the majors in the colleges that have the share of men more than 90 percents or women less than 10 percent. It can be seen the median incomes start at `40000` Annual US dollar which is less than Medical Assistant Services by `2000` US dollar. In addition, the result of Military Technology is so interesting because this major doesn't have any women in this major.

Above mention, It can be seen that America is one of the world's largest economies, however, there is still a problem with gender equality. Thus the US government should to concern and find solutions to solve this issue. By solving this problem, America's people will be happy and able to live in a constantly changing economy.
